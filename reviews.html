      <p class="Desc">The Good. Just picked up my Audi S4 from getting the windshield replaced. They did an excellent
        job on the windshield and they were over $300 cheaper than Safelite; best part is they used a Audi Factory
        windshield. For the windshield they get 5 stars. Now for the bad. Got a regular car wash and my car was not
        vacuumed out, they were washing a car next to mine and the entire drivers side had water spots all over it.
        Every single rim was dirty, and to top it off my car has a dent in the rear drivers side panel that was not
        there previously. I just picked up my car 4 hours ago. I will call them tomorrow and see what they say.</p>

      <p class="Desc">Prairie View Detailing is a great shop for all your car needs ir concerns. The shop manager, is a
        great guy who takes his position with pride and integrity. The shop is always clean and well maintained. The
        prices are somewhat reasonable for services, basically what's come to be expected from franchise boutique shops.
